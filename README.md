User Stories:

1. John went to the Alps over the summer and has decided to record the pictures and experiences into the journal. He created a new entry and inputted the pictures into the entry.

2. Jeffrey went on a hike in the forest and found a cave. He checked online and couldnâ€™t find any information on it. He decided to use GeoJournal to record the cave. He gave it a name, pinned its coordinates on the embedded map because the cave has no address. He can now find the cave easily by starting a GPS route with the map.

3. George is looking for apartments to rent. He uses GeoJournal to keep track of the apartments he looks at. He uses the text box for descriptions to write about what he thinks about each apartment so he can show his friend who he wants to be roommates with so they can make a decision on which apartment to rent.

4. Patrick uses GeoJournal for storing restuarants he went to. He wants to go to a restuarant that he made an entry for a while ago. He uses the list of entries where every entry hes made is recorded on. The default placements of the entries are newest first so he sorts by oldest to find the entry. He then sorts by newest again to go back to the default.

5. Jimmy found a bar that he liked so he made an entry for it. the bar changed its name and address so Jimmy edited those things. The bar closed down to Jimmy deleted the entry.
