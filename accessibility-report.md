Equitable Use
The program provides features that are accessible to all users regardless of their abilities, such as a simple User Interface with clearly defined features for Map, Weather, adding and deleting pictures, sorting entries and creating or deleting older entries that are not useful anymore.
In the future, we could implement a separate text area for notes and considerations to make the user aware of any problems that could make their experience harder at a certain location. We should also add visual features like screen reader and themes to make the application accessible to blind or partially-blind people. 
Flexibility in Use
The program allows users to freely edit, manage and input information in their own personal entries and entries blogs, accommodating a wide range of users who may have diverse methods of obtaining and organizing data.
In the future we could include an automatic GPS location gathering and voice commands to input all the necessary Data for users to create an entry.
Simple and Intuitive Use
The interface is not complex, with clear labels and sub labels, as well as buttons  ("Map", "Images", "Delete") that guide users through the process of interacting with the application.
Error messages are accessible for all users with specific mistakes and concrete language, this helps users correct mistakes like invalid numerical inputs without confusion.
Perceptible Information
The words used in the text labels and error messages are colloquial, avoiding confusion and ambiguity with bombastic words. They are also concrete with the use of a visible font suitable for all audiences.
For the moment all the user interface is in english, so in the future it could be a great add-on to have a translation tool to provide multi-language support for a global audience.
Tolerance for Error
The program includes several input validation, preventing incorrect or incomplete data (for example the weather feature check for invalid latitude or longitude values) avoiding unpredictable behavior.
We have an "Edit" button that allows users to correct input mistakes easily or change prior entries without any major complications such as creating a whole new entry. The map and weather feature also allow changes, just need to change the parameters and you receive the desired result. 


Low Physical Effort
The application minimizes physical effort since everyone with access to a machine that can execute the app can create their personal entry blog. It only requires a few clicks and description information without any word limit.
Map and Weather features are optional, the user is never required to input those values in order to create a new entry, however it adds a bonus to the entry. In these cases automatic location detection or voice input could reduce the effort even further in future versions.
Size and Space for Approach and Use
The program is designed to fit within a simple Java GUI window size and uses a reduced amount and allocation of computational resources, making it accessible for users with limited access to technology.
Future improvements might include resizing elements to accommodate different screen sizes.


Target Audience
The program would primarily target individuals who need local, quick and reliable entry blogs to save information from previous places that the user liked. Some of the users that could use the app are outdoor enthusiasts, travelers, tourists, families, and even professionals like drivers or farmers. The easy accessibility and display of the program makes it friendly to a lot of users that are not restricted to people who travel regularly, but also to students and teachers as a tool for geographic learning. The app is also suitable for people with limited internet connectivity and technological resources. With further development, the app could also have a global approach.


Demographics
From the perspective of the medical model, which is the interaction on individual impairments and how they can limit someone's ability to use technology, the program may be less accessible to individuals with certain disabilities, such as visual disabilities or motor disabilities. For example, users who are blind are physically restrained from using the app since thereâ€™s no hearing aid, while those with limited motor skills might find it difficult to input all the information manually. 
From the social model, which is the interaction of societal barriers that prevent participation, the program might be less likely to be used by people that lack access to internet. Although the program has a low resource usage, internet is necessary to place a location and to check the weather. Additionally, the reliance on manual location input and weather coordinates assumes users have access to geographical knowledge or external tools, which could limit users with restricted education and learning resources.
